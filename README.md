Potion Utils is a projec aimed to supply code and utilities for *[the potion programming language](https://github.com/perl11/potion)*.

Not specifically as means of making the language used but as a fun project.

It is currently in development and new modules will be added.

Next up is :

 * Vim plugin for potion syntax highlighting
 * Potion custom documentation to learn and use the language
